# Quick Start

## Create Your First Page

Create a new file at `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx
# Welcome to My Documentation

This is my first page using Nextra!
```

## Add More Pages

Create additional pages in the `pages` directory:

```mdx
# About

This is the about page.
```

## Customize Navigation

Edit `pages/_meta.js` to customize your navigation:

```js
export default {
  "index": "Introduction",
  "about": "About"
}
```

## Add Components

You can use React components in your MDX files:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'your-components'

<Button>Click me!</Button>
```
