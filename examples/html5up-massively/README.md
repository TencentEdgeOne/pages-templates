This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

## Form Configuration

This template includes a dynamic contact form powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io). To set up the form:

1. Register at [Formspree](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form and copy the form ID (e.g., `xabcdefg`)
3. Edit the `config.js` file and update your form ID:
   ```javascript
   window.ENV = {
       "NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM": "xabcdefg"
   };
   ```

The form will automatically use your Formspree endpoint (https://formspree.io/f/) for submissions.
